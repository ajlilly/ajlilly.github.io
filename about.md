All things regrettably Anna, yodeled down the goat trails of the Rockies
straight home to California and beyond for your bewilderment. I finally
have an excuse to blog like my mom and Vanessa did! Technically public,
this MySpace I never had can be obscure and themeless, an outlet and a
bulletin at the same time. Ideal. Not many people have the link — so if
you think I’m embarrassing myself, you can just cut my losses for me and
keep it to yourself. Hey, thanks!
